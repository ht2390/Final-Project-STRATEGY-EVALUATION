# Final-Project-STRATEGY-EVALUATION
The final project for 2022 Python for Machine Learning &amp; Data Science Masterclass

## Background
Congratulations on completing your study on Machine Learning Masterclass! This is the final assignment to test your handling skills on Python, Numpy, Pandas, and **Scikit-learn**. You will need to implement your previous **marketsimcode** to generate comparing plots for different trading strategies.

## Overview
This final project contains 3 steps of work:
1. indicator selection 
 - Technical indicators are very important signals for trading strategy. Choose at least 2 technical indicators from **indicators.py** or add your own technical indicators into it. You need to import **indicators.py** at your next step work.
 - It will be better if you can plot the specifically chosen indicators on your final comparing pictures.(Ie. Bollinger Bands) 
2. Implement a Manual Strategy 
 - Using your intuition and the indicators selected above, create a manual rules-based strategy and test it against a stock using your market
3. Implement a Strategy Learner
 - Created a machine-learning-model strategy learner by using **Scikit-learn** or building up your own codes. Then compare the performance with your manual startegy and benchmark strategy.
